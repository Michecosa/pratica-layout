# HTML/CSS Layout Practice

This repository contains a collection of layouts I built while practicing HTML and CSS.  
The goal is to replicate reference images (such as website mockups, UI snippets, or design challenges) as closely as possible, focusing on structure, responsiveness, and clean code.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder contains:
- The HTML and CSS files for the layout
- (Optional) The reference image used for the challenge

## 🚀 Purpose
- Improve my front-end development skills
- Practice semantic HTML
- Experiment with different CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid, positioning, responsive design, etc.)
- Recreate designs from images to sharpen attention to detail

## 🔧 Technologies
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)

## 🌱 Future Improvements
- Add responsive versions of each layout
- Explore animations and transitions
- Experiment with accessibility best practices
